# Introduction To .NET Framework (16 Periods)

## 1.1 **Introduction to .NET Framework**

### **What is the .NET Framework?**
The .NET Framework is a comprehensive software development platform developed by Microsoft, primarily for building and running applications on Windows. It provides a large class library known as the **Framework Class Library (FCL)**, which supports a wide range of functionalities such as file input/output, database interaction, graphical user interfaces, and web services.

### **Dot Net Architecture**
The .NET Framework follows a multi-layer architecture that simplifies the development of applications by providing reusable libraries and a runtime environment. The major components of the .NET architecture are:

- **Common Language Runtime (CLR)**: The runtime environment responsible for executing .NET applications. The CLR handles various tasks such as garbage collection, memory management, and exception handling.
- **Framework Class Library (FCL)**: A collection of predefined classes, functions, and libraries that make it easier to develop applications.
- **Common Type System (CTS)**: A set of rules defining how types are declared and used across different .NET languages.
- **Interoperability**: .NET provides seamless interoperability with unmanaged code, allowing .NET applications to interact with native applications and libraries.

#### **Managed Code and the CLR**
Managed code is code that is executed by the CLR, offering benefits such as automatic memory management and type safety. The CLR abstracts hardware and OS differences, ensuring that .NET applications run consistently across different machines.

##### Example:
```csharp
// Managed code example
int number = 10;  // The CLR manages the memory for this variable
```

#### **Intermediate Language (IL)**
.NET code is first compiled into Intermediate Language (IL), which is platform-independent. The CLR's **Just-In-Time (JIT)** compiler converts the IL code into native machine code when the application runs.

- **Why IL?** IL allows .NET applications to be platform-agnostic during development, and JIT compilation optimizes performance at runtime.
  
```csharp
// Code before JIT compilation
public void MyFunction() {
    Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
}
```

#### **Metadata and JIT Compilation**
Every .NET assembly contains metadata that describes the types and members defined in the code. The JIT compiler uses this metadata to convert the IL into executable code tailored for the host machine.

##### Example:
```csharp
// The metadata in an assembly defines the structure of this class
public class HelloWorld {
    public void SayHello() {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

#### **Automatic Memory Management**
.NET uses a **Garbage Collector (GC)** to automatically manage memory. It frees the developer from manually allocating and deallocating memory, ensuring the application doesn’t run out of resources.

```csharp
// The garbage collector will eventually clean up unreferenced objects
public class MyClass {
    public void MyMethod() {
        MyClass obj = new MyClass();
    }
}
```

---

## 1.2 **Common Language Specification (CLS) – Assembly – Namespace**

### **Common Language Specification (CLS)**
The CLS is a set of rules that ensure interoperability among the .NET languages (e.g., C#, VB.NET, F#). It provides a common standard that different languages can adhere to, ensuring that they can work together seamlessly.

- **Why CLS?** To ensure that code written in different .NET languages can be used together without issues.

#### **Assembly**
An assembly is a compiled code library used by .NET applications. It contains code, metadata, and resource information.

- **Types of Assemblies**:
  - **Private Assembly**: Used by a single application.
  - **Shared Assembly**: Can be used by multiple applications.
  
Assemblies have the file extensions `.exe` (for executable applications) or `.dll` (for libraries).

```bash
// Example of an Assembly in a Visual Studio project
MyApplication.exe  // Executable file (Assembly)
MyLibrary.dll      // Library (Assembly)
```

#### **Namespace**
A namespace is a container that holds classes, interfaces, and other namespaces, ensuring that name conflicts do not occur.

```csharp
namespace MyApplication {
    public class MyClass {
        public void DisplayMessage() {
            Console.WriteLine("Hello from MyClass!");
        }
    }
}
```

## 1.3 **Visual Studio .NET**

### **What is Visual Studio?**
Visual Studio is an integrated development environment (IDE) developed by Microsoft for building .NET applications. It provides tools for coding, debugging, and testing .NET applications.

### **System Requirements**
To install Visual Studio, your system needs to meet certain requirements based on the version you’re using:

- **Operating System**: Windows 10 or later (for Visual Studio 2022).
- **Memory**: At least 4 GB RAM (8 GB recommended).
- **Disk Space**: 1 GB free space for minimal installation, up to 50 GB for full installation.

### **Using the .NET Framework in Visual Studio**
You can develop a variety of .NET applications using Visual Studio, from console applications to complex web applications with ASP.NET.

```bash
// Create a new project in Visual Studio for .NET development
1. Open Visual Studio
2. Select "Create a New Project"
3. Choose ".NET Core Web Application"
4. Choose "ASP.NET Core Web API"
```

### **Versions of Visual Studio**
- **Visual Studio 2019**: Supports .NET Framework 4.x and .NET Core.
- **Visual Studio 2022**: Supports .NET 5 and .NET 6+ and provides enhanced features for debugging, performance, and cloud development.

---

## 1.4 **The Framework Class Library (FCL) – .NET Objects – ASP.NET – .NET Web Services – Windows Forms**

### **What is the Framework Class Library (FCL)?**
The FCL is a vast collection of reusable classes, interfaces, and value types that provide a range of functionalities such as file I/O, database interaction, and networking. It simplifies the development process by providing ready-to-use solutions.

#### Example of Using FCL:
```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;

class Program {
    static void Main() {
        // Example of File I/O in FCL
        string path = @"C:\example.txt";
        File.WriteAllText(path, "Hello, FCL!");
        string content = File.ReadAllText(path);
        Console.WriteLine(content);
    }
}
```

### **.NET Objects**
.NET objects are instances of classes defined in the .NET Framework. These objects follow the object-oriented programming principles and can be manipulated through methods and properties.

#### Example:
```csharp
public class Student {
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public int Age { get; set; }
    
    public void DisplayInfo() {
        Console.WriteLine($"Name: {Name}, Age: {Age}");
    }
}
```

### **ASP.NET**
ASP.NET is a web development framework for building dynamic web applications and services. It provides powerful tools for building web forms, MVC applications, and web APIs.

#### Example of an ASP.NET Web Form:
```html
<%@ Page Language="C#" AutoEventWireup="true" CodeBehind="Default.aspx.cs" Inherits="WebApplication1._Default" %>
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
    <h2>Welcome to ASP.NET!</h2>
    <form runat="server">
        <asp:Button ID="Button1" runat="server" Text="Click Me" OnClick="Button1_Click" />
    </form>
</body>
</html>
```

### **.NET Web Services**
.NET Web Services allow applications to communicate over the internet using standard protocols like HTTP, SOAP, and REST. These services enable interoperability between different platforms and systems.

#### Example of a Simple .NET Web Service (SOAP):
```csharp
// ASP.NET Web Service Example
[WebService(Namespace = "http://tempuri.org/")]
public class HelloWorld : System.Web.Services.WebService {
    [WebMethod]
    public string SayHello() {
        return "Hello, World!";
    }
}
```

### **Windows Forms**
Windows Forms is a GUI (Graphical User Interface) framework for building desktop applications in .NET. It provides a set of controls (buttons, text boxes, labels) that allow developers to create user-friendly applications.

#### Example of a Simple Windows Form Application:
```csharp
public class MyForm : Form {
    public MyForm() {
        Button btn = new Button();
        btn.Text = "Click Me!";
        btn.Click += new EventHandler(btn_Click);
        this.Controls.Add(btn);
    }

    private void btn_Click(object sender, EventArgs e) {
        MessageBox.Show("Hello from Windows Forms!");
    }

    [STAThread]
    static void Main() {
        Application.Run(new MyForm());
    }
}
```

The .NET Framework is a comprehensive platform that simplifies the development of robust and scalable applications. With tools like Visual Studio, rich libraries in the FCL, and support for multiple programming languages, the .NET Framework enables developers to build applications that run on various devices and platforms, from desktop to web services. Understanding its architecture, libraries, and tools such as ASP.NET and Windows Forms is essential for effective .NET development.

# Introduction to C# (16 Periods)

## 2.1 Elements: Variables, Constants, Data Types, Declaration

### Variables and Constants

#### **Variables**:
A **variable** is a storage location in memory used to hold data. Variables can change their values throughout the program.

**Syntax**:
```csharp
int age; // Declaring an integer variable
age = 25; // Assigning a value
```

- **Declaration**: A variable is declared by specifying its data type, followed by its name.
  - **Example**: `int age;`

#### **Constants**:
A **constant** is a variable whose value cannot be modified after it's assigned. They are declared using the `const` keyword.

**Syntax**:
```csharp
const double pi = 3.14; // Declaring a constant
```

Constants help ensure that certain values remain unchanged throughout the program, improving reliability and readability.

#### **Why use variables and constants?**
- **Variables**: Allow you to store and modify data during runtime.
- **Constants**: Ensure that certain values remain constant, reducing errors caused by accidental modifications.

### Data Types

#### **Primitive Data Types**:
In C#, data types specify the type of data a variable can hold. The most common primitive data types are:
- **int**: Used for integers.
- **double**: For floating-point numbers (decimals).
- **char**: For storing a single character.
- **bool**: For true/false values.
- **string**: For text.

#### **Type Declaration**:
- **Syntax**:
```csharp
int number = 100;  // Integer
double price = 19.99; // Decimal number
bool isValid = true;  // Boolean value
char grade = 'A';  // Single character
string name = "offtopcis";  // Text string
```

#### **Why is knowing data types important?**
Knowing the data type ensures that variables are used correctly and helps in efficient memory management.

### Operators

C# supports various operators that are used to perform operations on variables and values. These include:

- **Arithmetic Operators**: Used for mathematical calculations.
  - Example: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
- **Comparison Operators**: Used to compare values.
  - Example: `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`
- **Logical Operators**: Used for logical operations.
  - Example: `&&` (AND), `||` (OR), `!` (NOT)

**Operator Precedence**: Determines the order in which operations are evaluated in an expression.
- **Example**:
```csharp
int result = 5 + 10 * 2;  // 5 + 20 = 25, as multiplication has higher precedence than addition
```

### Expressions

An **expression** is a combination of variables, constants, operators, and function calls that are evaluated to produce a value.

**Example**:
```csharp
int sum = 5 + 10; // Expression results in 15
```

### Program Flow: Decision Statements

Decision-making allows the program to take different actions based on conditions.

#### **if..then**:
Used to execute a block of code if a condition is true.
```csharp
if (age >= 18)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Adult");
}
```

#### **if..then..else**:
Allows an alternative block of code to be executed when the condition is false.
```csharp
if (age >= 18)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Adult");
}
else
{
    Console.WriteLine("Minor");
}
```

#### **switch..case**:
Used when there are multiple possible conditions. It's a cleaner way to handle multiple `if..else` conditions.
```csharp
switch (day)
{
    case 1:
        Console.WriteLine("Monday");
        break;
    case 2:
        Console.WriteLine("Tuesday");
        break;
    default:
        Console.WriteLine("Invalid day");
        break;
}
```

## 2.2 Loop Statements

Loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly, as long as a condition is true.

#### **while..end while**:
The `while` loop continues to execute as long as the condition is true.
```csharp
int i = 0;
while (i < 5)
{
    Console.WriteLine(i);
    i++;
}
```

#### **do..loop**:
The `do..while` loop executes at least once and then repeats based on the condition.
```csharp
int j = 0;
do
{
    Console.WriteLine(j);
    j++;
} while (j < 5);
```

#### **for..next**:
The `for` loop is useful when you know the number of iterations beforehand.
```csharp
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
{
    Console.WriteLine(i);
}
```

#### **for..each..next**:
The `foreach` loop is used to iterate over collections like arrays or lists.
```csharp
int[] numbers = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
foreach (int number in numbers)
{
    Console.WriteLine(number);
}
```

## 2.3 Types

### Value Data Types

- **Structures (Structs)**: A structure is a data type that can hold multiple values of different types. It's value-based and passed by value.
```csharp
struct Point
{
    public int X;
    public int Y;
}

Point p = new Point();
p.X = 10;
p.Y = 20;
```

- **Enumerations (Enums)**: An `enum` is a distinct type that defines a set of named constants.
```csharp
enum Day { Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday }
Day today = Day.Monday;
```

### Reference Data Types

- **Arrays**: Arrays are collections of elements of the same type. They can be single-dimensional, multi-dimensional, or jagged.
  - **Single-Dimensional**: A basic array.
  ```csharp
  int[] numbers = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
  ```
  - **Multi-Dimensional**: Arrays with more than one dimension.
  ```csharp
  int[,] matrix = new int[2, 2] { {1, 2}, {3, 4} };
  ```
  - **Jagged Arrays**: Arrays of arrays.
  ```csharp
  int[][] jaggedArray = new int[2][];
  jaggedArray[0] = new int[] { 1, 2 };
  jaggedArray[1] = new int[] { 3, 4, 5 };
  ```
  - **Dynamic Arrays**: Arrays whose size can be changed during runtime.
  ```csharp
  List<int> dynamicList = new List<int>();
  dynamicList.Add(1);
  dynamicList.Add(2);
  ```

## 2.4 Classes & Objects, Object-Oriented Concepts

### **Classes & Objects**:

- **Class**: A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines properties, methods, and behaviors.
```csharp
class Car
{
    public string Make;
    public string Model;

    public void StartEngine()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Engine started");
    }
}
```

- **Object**: An instance of a class.
```csharp
Car myCar = new Car();
myCar.Make = "Toyota";
myCar.Model = "Corolla";
myCar.StartEngine();
```

### Object-Oriented Concepts:

#### **Abstraction**:
Abstraction hides the implementation details and shows only the necessary features of the object.
```csharp
abstract class Animal
{
    public abstract void MakeSound();
}

class Dog : Animal
{
    public override void MakeSound()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Bark");
    }
}
```

#### **Inheritance**:
Inheritance allows a class to inherit methods and properties from another class.
```csharp
class Vehicle
{
    public string Brand = "Toyota";
}

class Car : Vehicle
{
    public string Model = "Corolla";
}
```

#### **Polymorphism**:
Polymorphism allows methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon.
```csharp
class Animal
{
    public virtual void MakeSound() { Console.WriteLine("Animal sound"); }
}

class Dog : Animal
{
    public override void MakeSound() { Console.WriteLine("Bark"); }
}
```

#### **Debugging**:
Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors in the program. It can be done using Visual Studio’s built-in debugging tools like breakpoints, watches, and step-through debugging.

# Windows Application Using Window Forms (16 Periods)

## 3.1 **Windows Programming – Creating Windows Forms**

### **What are Windows Forms?**

Windows Forms (commonly referred to as WinForms) is a graphical user interface (GUI) class library included with the Microsoft .NET Framework. It is a foundational tool for developing desktop applications for the Windows operating system. WinForms provides developers with a set of pre-built controls that allow them to build a user interface for their applications by simply dragging and dropping elements like buttons, text boxes, and labels onto a form.

A **form** in WinForms is essentially a window that serves as the main container for your application's user interface. Think of it as a canvas where you place various controls (elements like buttons, text boxes, and labels). The form is the entry point to your application, and it can be thought of as the container or shell that houses other controls and events that make up the logic of your program.

The simplicity of Windows Forms lies in its drag-and-drop approach to building user interfaces, allowing developers to focus more on the logic of their programs rather than worrying about the low-level details of creating a user interface.

---

### **Creating a Simple Windows Form Application**

To create a Windows Forms application, you typically start by designing a **form** where you can place controls like buttons, labels, and text boxes. Here's a step-by-step example:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Windows.Forms;

namespace WinFormsApp
{
    public class MainForm : Form
    {
        public MainForm()
        {
            // Set the title of the form
            this.Text = "Hello WinForms!";
            
            // Create a Button control
            Button btnClickMe = new Button();
            btnClickMe.Text = "Click Me";
            btnClickMe.Location = new System.Drawing.Point(100, 100);
            
            // Event handler for the button click
            btnClickMe.Click += (sender, e) => MessageBox.Show("Button clicked!");
            
            // Add the button to the form
            this.Controls.Add(btnClickMe);
        }

        // Main entry point for the application
        public static void Main()
        {
            Application.Run(new MainForm());
        }
    }
}
```

In this example:
- We create a `MainForm` class, which inherits from the `Form` class.
- We set the title of the form to `"Hello WinForms!"`.
- We create a `Button` control, set its text to `"Click Me"`, and specify its location on the form.
- We attach an event handler to the button's `Click` event that shows a message box when the button is clicked.
- Finally, the `Main` method runs the application, displaying the form and its controls.

---

### **Working with Toolbox Controls:**
Windows Forms applications use various **toolbox controls** to create rich user interfaces. The Toolbox is a panel in the design view of a form where you can select and drag controls (like buttons, textboxes, etc.) onto the form.

Some common controls used in Windows Forms are:

#### **Button**
- **Definition**: A Button control is a simple yet crucial element that triggers an action when clicked by the user. Buttons are the primary way to handle user interactions in a graphical application.
- **Why use it?**: Buttons are essential for initiating events, such as submitting forms, opening dialog boxes, or starting processes. They provide a way for users to interact with the application by triggering specific actions.

```csharp
Button button1 = new Button();
button1.Text = "Submit";
button1.Location = new Point(30, 30);
button1.Click += Button1_Click;
```

#### **CheckBox**
- **Definition**: A CheckBox control provides a way for users to select or deselect a binary choice, typically representing a yes/no, on/off, or true/false value.
- **Why use it?**: Checkboxes are used when you want the user to make a selection from a set of options, where multiple selections might be allowed, or only one option needs to be toggled at a time.

```csharp
CheckBox checkBox1 = new CheckBox();
checkBox1.Text = "Accept Terms";
checkBox1.Location = new Point(30, 60);
```

#### **ComboBox**
- **Definition**: A ComboBox is a control that allows the user to select from a list of items, either by typing or by clicking a dropdown list. It combines a TextBox and a ListBox into a single control.
- **Why use it?**: It is used when you want to provide the user with a list of options to choose from without taking up too much space. It is ideal for cases where the list of items may be long, but you don’t want to overwhelm the user by displaying all the options at once.

```csharp
ComboBox comboBox1 = new ComboBox();
comboBox1.Items.Add("Option 1");
comboBox1.Items.Add("Option 2");
comboBox1.Location = new Point(30, 90);
```

#### **Label**
- **Definition**: A Label control is a simple text-based control that is used to display static text on the form. It doesn’t interact with the user, but it serves to provide information or instructions.
- **Why use it?**: Labels are used for displaying non-interactive text like form instructions, field names, or explanatory text.

```csharp
Label label1 = new Label();
label1.Text = "Enter your name:";
label1.Location = new Point(30, 120);
```

#### **ListBox**
- **Definition**: A ListBox control is used to display a list of items, allowing the user to select one or more items. Unlike ComboBox, the ListBox typically displays all available options at once, without requiring the user to click a dropdown.
- **Why use it?**: ListBoxes are useful when you need to display a list of options for the user to select from, and you want to provide a larger visual area to show multiple items simultaneously.

```csharp
ListBox listBox1 = new ListBox();
listBox1.Items.Add("Item 1");
listBox1.Items.Add("Item 2");
listBox1.Location = new Point(30, 150);
```

#### **RadioButton**
- **Definition**: A RadioButton control is used in a group where only one option can be selected at a time. It represents a mutually exclusive choice in a set of options.
- **Why use it?**: Radio buttons are ideal when the user needs to choose only one option from a set of related options, such as selecting a payment method or choosing a shipping option.

```csharp
RadioButton radioButton1 = new RadioButton();
radioButton1.Text = "Option A";
radioButton1.Location = new Point(30, 180);
```

#### **TextBox**
- **Definition**: A TextBox control allows the user to enter text into the application. It can be used for any form of textual input, such as entering a name, password, or address.
- **Why use it?**: Text boxes are essential for gathering textual input from users. They allow users to type in custom information.

```csharp
TextBox textBox1 = new TextBox();
textBox1.Location = new Point(30, 210);
```

#### **GroupBox**
- **Definition**: A GroupBox control is used to group a set of related controls together, visually. It can help in organizing the user interface by grouping related elements, such as options or settings.
- **Why use it?**: GroupBoxes are used to make the user interface more organized and to help users understand the relationship between various controls, like grouping related settings together.

```csharp
GroupBox groupBox1 = new GroupBox();
groupBox1.Text = "Personal Information";
groupBox1.Location = new Point(20, 240);
groupBox1.Size = new Size(300, 200);
```

#### **PictureBox**
- **Definition**: A PictureBox control is used to display images, graphics, or pictures on a form. It can load images from files, streams, or other sources.
- **Why use it?**: PictureBoxes are commonly used to display logos, user profile images, or any other image-based content within a Windows Forms application.

```csharp
PictureBox pictureBox1 = new PictureBox();
pictureBox1.Image = Image.FromFile("image.jpg");
pictureBox1.Location = new Point(30, 270);
```

---

## 3.2 **Advanced Controls & Events**

### **Timer Control**

The **Timer** control in Windows Forms is used to execute a piece of code repeatedly at a specified interval. It is especially useful when you need to update the UI or perform periodic operations, such as animations, background tasks, or progress updates.

```csharp
Timer timer = new Timer();
timer.Interval = 1000; // 1 second interval
timer.Tick += (sender, e) => { /* Code to execute every second */ };
timer.Start();
```

**Why use it?**: Timers are commonly used for actions that need to be executed in the background without user intervention, such as updating a progress bar or periodically checking for new data from a server.

---

### **ProgressBar Control**

A **ProgressBar** is a graphical control that visually indicates the progress of a task. It is useful when you want to show the user how much of a task has been completed (e.g., downloading a file or processing data).

```csharp
ProgressBar progressBar1 = new ProgressBar();
progressBar1.Maximum = 100;
progressBar1.Value = 50;  // The progress bar is at 50%
progressBar1.Location = new Point(30, 300);
```

**Why use it?**: Progress bars improve the user experience by providing feedback during long-running operations, letting the user know the status of the task.

---

### **MonthCalendar Control**

The **MonthCalendar** control is used to display a calendar. It allows the user to select a date or range of dates from a visual calendar interface.

```csharp
MonthCalendar monthCalendar1 = new MonthCalendar();
monthCalendar1.Location = new Point(30, 330);
```

**Why use it?**: Month calendars are useful for applications that require users to pick dates, such as booking systems, event planners, or any form where date selection is required.

---

### **ToolTip Control**

A **ToolTip** is a small pop-up window that provides helpful information when the user hovers over a control. It is used to give users hints or descriptions without cluttering the UI with too much text.

```csharp
ToolTip toolTip1 = new ToolTip();
toolTip1.SetToolTip(button1, "Click this button to submit.");
```

**Why use it?**: Tooltips are an excellent way to improve the usability of an application by providing additional context or instructions when the user interacts with various elements.

---

### **TabControl**

A **TabControl** is a container that organizes a set of tab pages. It allows the user to switch between different sections of an application, making it useful for organizing a large amount of content in a single window.

```csharp
TabControl tabControl1 = new TabControl();
TabPage tabPage1 = new TabPage("Tab 1");
tabControl1.TabPages.Add(tabPage1);
tabControl1.Location = new Point(30, 360);
```

**Why use it?**: Tab controls are typically used when the application needs to display multiple sections or categories of information, and the user

 can switch between them easily.


In conclusion, Windows Forms is a powerful and easy-to-use technology for creating Windows desktop applications. It allows developers to build graphical interfaces by placing controls onto forms and handling events through simple code. Understanding the different controls and their usage is key to building user-friendly, interactive desktop applications.
