# Introduction To .NET Framework (16 Periods)

## 1.1 **Introduction to .NET Framework**

### **What is the .NET Framework?**
The .NET Framework is a comprehensive software development platform developed by Microsoft, primarily for building and running applications on Windows. It provides a large class library known as the **Framework Class Library (FCL)**, which supports a wide range of functionalities such as file input/output, database interaction, graphical user interfaces, and web services.

### **Dot Net Architecture**
The .NET Framework follows a multi-layer architecture that simplifies the development of applications by providing reusable libraries and a runtime environment. The major components of the .NET architecture are:

- **Common Language Runtime (CLR)**: The runtime environment responsible for executing .NET applications. The CLR handles various tasks such as garbage collection, memory management, and exception handling.
- **Framework Class Library (FCL)**: A collection of predefined classes, functions, and libraries that make it easier to develop applications.
- **Common Type System (CTS)**: A set of rules defining how types are declared and used across different .NET languages.
- **Interoperability**: .NET provides seamless interoperability with unmanaged code, allowing .NET applications to interact with native applications and libraries.

#### **Managed Code and the CLR**
Managed code is code that is executed by the CLR, offering benefits such as automatic memory management and type safety. The CLR abstracts hardware and OS differences, ensuring that .NET applications run consistently across different machines.

##### Example:
```csharp
// Managed code example
int number = 10;  // The CLR manages the memory for this variable
```

#### **Intermediate Language (IL)**
.NET code is first compiled into Intermediate Language (IL), which is platform-independent. The CLR's **Just-In-Time (JIT)** compiler converts the IL code into native machine code when the application runs.

- **Why IL?** IL allows .NET applications to be platform-agnostic during development, and JIT compilation optimizes performance at runtime.
  
```csharp
// Code before JIT compilation
public void MyFunction() {
    Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
}
```

#### **Metadata and JIT Compilation**
Every .NET assembly contains metadata that describes the types and members defined in the code. The JIT compiler uses this metadata to convert the IL into executable code tailored for the host machine.

##### Example:
```csharp
// The metadata in an assembly defines the structure of this class
public class HelloWorld {
    public void SayHello() {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

#### **Automatic Memory Management**
.NET uses a **Garbage Collector (GC)** to automatically manage memory. It frees the developer from manually allocating and deallocating memory, ensuring the application doesn’t run out of resources.

```csharp
// The garbage collector will eventually clean up unreferenced objects
public class MyClass {
    public void MyMethod() {
        MyClass obj = new MyClass();
    }
}
```

---

## 1.2 **Common Language Specification (CLS) – Assembly – Namespace**

### **Common Language Specification (CLS)**
The CLS is a set of rules that ensure interoperability among the .NET languages (e.g., C#, VB.NET, F#). It provides a common standard that different languages can adhere to, ensuring that they can work together seamlessly.

- **Why CLS?** To ensure that code written in different .NET languages can be used together without issues.

#### **Assembly**
An assembly is a compiled code library used by .NET applications. It contains code, metadata, and resource information.

- **Types of Assemblies**:
  - **Private Assembly**: Used by a single application.
  - **Shared Assembly**: Can be used by multiple applications.
  
Assemblies have the file extensions `.exe` (for executable applications) or `.dll` (for libraries).

```bash
// Example of an Assembly in a Visual Studio project
MyApplication.exe  // Executable file (Assembly)
MyLibrary.dll      // Library (Assembly)
```

#### **Namespace**
A namespace is a container that holds classes, interfaces, and other namespaces, ensuring that name conflicts do not occur.

```csharp
namespace MyApplication {
    public class MyClass {
        public void DisplayMessage() {
            Console.WriteLine("Hello from MyClass!");
        }
    }
}
```

## 1.3 **Visual Studio .NET**

### **What is Visual Studio?**
Visual Studio is an integrated development environment (IDE) developed by Microsoft for building .NET applications. It provides tools for coding, debugging, and testing .NET applications.

### **System Requirements**
To install Visual Studio, your system needs to meet certain requirements based on the version you’re using:

- **Operating System**: Windows 10 or later (for Visual Studio 2022).
- **Memory**: At least 4 GB RAM (8 GB recommended).
- **Disk Space**: 1 GB free space for minimal installation, up to 50 GB for full installation.

### **Using the .NET Framework in Visual Studio**
You can develop a variety of .NET applications using Visual Studio, from console applications to complex web applications with ASP.NET.

```bash
// Create a new project in Visual Studio for .NET development
1. Open Visual Studio
2. Select "Create a New Project"
3. Choose ".NET Core Web Application"
4. Choose "ASP.NET Core Web API"
```

### **Versions of Visual Studio**
- **Visual Studio 2019**: Supports .NET Framework 4.x and .NET Core.
- **Visual Studio 2022**: Supports .NET 5 and .NET 6+ and provides enhanced features for debugging, performance, and cloud development.

## 1.4 **The Framework Class Library (FCL) – .NET Objects – ASP.NET – .NET Web Services – Windows Forms**

### **What is the Framework Class Library (FCL)?**
The FCL is a vast collection of reusable classes, interfaces, and value types that provide a range of functionalities such as file I/O, database interaction, and networking. It simplifies the development process by providing ready-to-use solutions.

#### Example of Using FCL:
```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;

class Program {
    static void Main() {
        // Example of File I/O in FCL
        string path = @"C:\example.txt";
        File.WriteAllText(path, "Hello, FCL!");
        string content = File.ReadAllText(path);
        Console.WriteLine(content);
    }
}
```

### **.NET Objects**
.NET objects are instances of classes defined in the .NET Framework. These objects follow the object-oriented programming principles and can be manipulated through methods and properties.

#### Example:
```csharp
public class Student {
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public int Age { get; set; }
    
    public void DisplayInfo() {
        Console.WriteLine($"Name: {Name}, Age: {Age}");
    }
}
```

### **ASP.NET**
ASP.NET is a web development framework for building dynamic web applications and services. It provides powerful tools for building web forms, MVC applications, and web APIs.

#### Example of an ASP.NET Web Form:
```html
<%@ Page Language="C#" AutoEventWireup="true" CodeBehind="Default.aspx.cs" Inherits="WebApplication1._Default" %>
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
    <h2>Welcome to ASP.NET!</h2>
    <form runat="server">
        <asp:Button ID="Button1" runat="server" Text="Click Me" OnClick="Button1_Click" />
    </form>
</body>
</html>
```

### **.NET Web Services**
.NET Web Services allow applications to communicate over the internet using standard protocols like HTTP, SOAP, and REST. These services enable interoperability between different platforms and systems.

#### Example of a Simple .NET Web Service (SOAP):
```csharp
// ASP.NET Web Service Example
[WebService(Namespace = "http://tempuri.org/")]
public class HelloWorld : System.Web.Services.WebService {
    [WebMethod]
    public string SayHello() {
        return "Hello, World!";
    }
}
```

### **Windows Forms**
Windows Forms is a GUI (Graphical User Interface) framework for building desktop applications in .NET. It provides a set of controls (buttons, text boxes, labels) that allow developers to create user-friendly applications.

#### Example of a Simple Windows Form Application:
```csharp
public class MyForm : Form {
    public MyForm() {
        Button btn = new Button();
        btn.Text = "Click Me!";
        btn.Click += new EventHandler(btn_Click);
        this.Controls.Add(btn);
    }

    private void btn_Click(object sender, EventArgs e) {
        MessageBox.Show("Hello from Windows Forms!");
    }

    [STAThread]
    static void Main() {
        Application.Run(new MyForm());
    }
}
```

The .NET Framework is a comprehensive platform that simplifies the development of robust and scalable applications. With tools like Visual Studio, rich libraries in the FCL, and support for multiple programming languages, the .NET Framework enables developers to build applications that run on various devices and platforms, from desktop to web services. Understanding its architecture, libraries, and tools such as ASP.NET and Windows Forms is essential for effective .NET development.

# Introduction to C# (16 Periods)

## 2.1 Elements: Variables, Constants, Data Types, Declaration

### Variables and Constants

#### **Variables**:
A **variable** is a storage location in memory used to hold data. Variables can change their values throughout the program.

**Syntax**:
```csharp
int age; // Declaring an integer variable
age = 25; // Assigning a value
```

- **Declaration**: A variable is declared by specifying its data type, followed by its name.
  - **Example**: `int age;`

#### **Constants**:
A **constant** is a variable whose value cannot be modified after it's assigned. They are declared using the `const` keyword.

**Syntax**:
```csharp
const double pi = 3.14; // Declaring a constant
```

Constants help ensure that certain values remain unchanged throughout the program, improving reliability and readability.

#### **Why use variables and constants?**
- **Variables**: Allow you to store and modify data during runtime.
- **Constants**: Ensure that certain values remain constant, reducing errors caused by accidental modifications.

### Data Types

#### **Primitive Data Types**:
In C#, data types specify the type of data a variable can hold. The most common primitive data types are:
- **int**: Used for integers.
- **double**: For floating-point numbers (decimals).
- **char**: For storing a single character.
- **bool**: For true/false values.
- **string**: For text.

#### **Type Declaration**:
- **Syntax**:
```csharp
int number = 100;  // Integer
double price = 19.99; // Decimal number
bool isValid = true;  // Boolean value
char grade = 'A';  // Single character
string name = "John";  // Text string
```

#### **Why is knowing data types important?**
Knowing the data type ensures that variables are used correctly and helps in efficient memory management.

### Operators

C# supports various operators that are used to perform operations on variables and values. These include:

- **Arithmetic Operators**: Used for mathematical calculations.
  - Example: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
- **Comparison Operators**: Used to compare values.
  - Example: `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`
- **Logical Operators**: Used for logical operations.
  - Example: `&&` (AND), `||` (OR), `!` (NOT)

**Operator Precedence**: Determines the order in which operations are evaluated in an expression.
- **Example**:
```csharp
int result = 5 + 10 * 2;  // 5 + 20 = 25, as multiplication has higher precedence than addition
```

### Expressions

An **expression** is a combination of variables, constants, operators, and function calls that are evaluated to produce a value.

**Example**:
```csharp
int sum = 5 + 10; // Expression results in 15
```

### Program Flow: Decision Statements

Decision-making allows the program to take different actions based on conditions.

#### **if..then**:
Used to execute a block of code if a condition is true.
```csharp
if (age >= 18)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Adult");
}
```

#### **if..then..else**:
Allows an alternative block of code to be executed when the condition is false.
```csharp
if (age >= 18)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Adult");
}
else
{
    Console.WriteLine("Minor");
}
```

#### **switch..case**:
Used when there are multiple possible conditions. It's a cleaner way to handle multiple `if..else` conditions.
```csharp
switch (day)
{
    case 1:
        Console.WriteLine("Monday");
        break;
    case 2:
        Console.WriteLine("Tuesday");
        break;
    default:
        Console.WriteLine("Invalid day");
        break;
}
```

## 2.2 Loop Statements

Loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly, as long as a condition is true.

#### **while..end while**:
The `while` loop continues to execute as long as the condition is true.
```csharp
int i = 0;
while (i < 5)
{
    Console.WriteLine(i);
    i++;
}
```

#### **do..loop**:
The `do..while` loop executes at least once and then repeats based on the condition.
```csharp
int j = 0;
do
{
    Console.WriteLine(j);
    j++;
} while (j < 5);
```

#### **for..next**:
The `for` loop is useful when you know the number of iterations beforehand.
```csharp
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
{
    Console.WriteLine(i);
}
```

#### **for..each..next**:
The `foreach` loop is used to iterate over collections like arrays or lists.
```csharp
int[] numbers = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
foreach (int number in numbers)
{
    Console.WriteLine(number);
}
```

## 2.3 Types

### Value Data Types

- **Structures (Structs)**: A structure is a data type that can hold multiple values of different types. It's value-based and passed by value.
```csharp
struct Point
{
    public int X;
    public int Y;
}

Point p = new Point();
p.X = 10;
p.Y = 20;
```

- **Enumerations (Enums)**: An `enum` is a distinct type that defines a set of named constants.
```csharp
enum Day { Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday }
Day today = Day.Monday;
```

### Reference Data Types

- **Arrays**: Arrays are collections of elements of the same type. They can be single-dimensional, multi-dimensional, or jagged.
  - **Single-Dimensional**: A basic array.
  ```csharp
  int[] numbers = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
  ```
  - **Multi-Dimensional**: Arrays with more than one dimension.
  ```csharp
  int[,] matrix = new int[2, 2] { {1, 2}, {3, 4} };
  ```
  - **Jagged Arrays**: Arrays of arrays.
  ```csharp
  int[][] jaggedArray = new int[2][];
  jaggedArray[0] = new int[] { 1, 2 };
  jaggedArray[1] = new int[] { 3, 4, 5 };
  ```
  - **Dynamic Arrays**: Arrays whose size can be changed during runtime.
  ```csharp
  List<int> dynamicList = new List<int>();
  dynamicList.Add(1);
  dynamicList.Add(2);
  ```

## 2.4 Classes & Objects, Object-Oriented Concepts

### **Classes & Objects**:

- **Class**: A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines properties, methods, and behaviors.
```csharp
class Car
{
    public string Make;
    public string Model;

    public void StartEngine()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Engine started");
    }
}
```

- **Object**: An instance of a class.
```csharp
Car myCar = new Car();
myCar.Make = "Toyota";
myCar.Model = "Corolla";
myCar.StartEngine();
```

### Object-Oriented Concepts:

#### **Abstraction**:
Abstraction hides the implementation details and shows only the necessary features of the object.
```csharp
abstract class Animal
{
    public abstract void MakeSound();
}

class Dog : Animal
{
    public override void MakeSound()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Bark");
    }
}
```

#### **Inheritance**:
Inheritance allows a class to inherit methods and properties from another class.
```csharp
class Vehicle
{
    public string Brand = "Toyota";
}

class Car : Vehicle
{
    public string Model = "Corolla";
}
```

#### **Polymorphism**:
Polymorphism allows methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon.
```csharp
class Animal
{
    public virtual void MakeSound() { Console.WriteLine("Animal sound"); }
}

class Dog : Animal
{
    public override void MakeSound() { Console.WriteLine("Bark"); }
}
```

#### **Debugging**:
Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors in the program. It can be done using Visual Studio’s built-in debugging tools like breakpoints, watches, and step-through debugging.
