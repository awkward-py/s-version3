### RATIONALE
C is the most widely used computer language, which is being taught as a core course. C is a general-purpose structural language that is powerful, efficient, and compact, which combines features of high-level language and low-level language. It is closer to both Man and Machine. Due to this inherent flexibility and tolerance, it is suitable for different development environments. Due to these powerful features, C has not lost its importance and popularity in the recently developed and advanced software industry. C can also be used for system-level programming and it is still considered as the first priority programming language. This course covers the basic concepts of C.
