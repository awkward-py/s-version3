## Basics of Software Engineering:

Software Engineering is the process of designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software. It is a systematic and disciplined approach to software development that aims to create high-quality, reliable, and maintainable software. It follows the engineering principles to create reliable, scalable, and maintainable software.

There are key principles like modularity, security, reusability, and testing that help in reducing development time, improving software performance, and making future updates easier. Software engineering is not just about coding—it involves proper planning, designing, testing, and maintaining software to meet user requirements effectively.

## Why do we need Software Engineering?

Software Engineering has many needs in today’s world. There are following points that tell about the need of Software Engineering:

- **Handles Large & Complex Projects** 🏗️
  - Helps in developing large-scale software systematically.
  - Breaks projects into manageable parts for better efficiency.

## What is Software and its characteristics 🤔🤔❔

Software is defined as a collection of computer programs, procedures, rules, and data.

### Characteristics of Software:

1. **Functionality**: The software meets the requirements and specifications that it was designed for, and it behaves as expected when it is used in its intended environment.
2. **Usability**: The software is easy to use and understand, and it provides a positive user experience.
3. **Reliability**: The software is free of defects and it performs consistently and accurately under different conditions and scenarios.
4. **Performance**: The software runs efficiently and quickly, and it can handle large amounts of data or traffic.
5. **Security**: The software is protected against unauthorized access and it keeps the data and functions safe from malicious attacks.
6. **Maintainability**: The software is easy to change and update, and it is well-documented, so that it can be understood and modified by other developers.
7. **Reusability**: The software can be reused in other projects or applications, and it is designed in a way that promotes code reuse.
8. **Scalability**: The software can handle an increasing workload and it can be easily extended to meet the changing requirements.
9. **Testability**: The software is designed in a way that makes it easy to test and validate, and it has a comprehensive test coverage.

## Software Myths 😶🌫️👾

Software Myths are beliefs that do not have any pure evidence. Software myths may lead to many misunderstandings, unrealistic expectations, and poor decision-making in software development projects.

### The types of software-related myths are listed below:

#### (i) Management Myths:

- **Myth 1**: We have all the standards and procedures available for software development.
  - **Fact**: Software experts do not know all the requirements for software development, and all existing processes are incomplete as new software development is based on new and different problems.

- **Myth 2**: The addition of the latest hardware programs will improve software development.
  - **Fact**: The role of the latest hardware is not very high on standard software development; instead, CASE (Computer-Aided Software Engineering) tools help more in producing quality and productivity.

- **Myth 3**: With the addition of more people and program planners, software development can meet project deadlines (if lagging behind).
  - **Fact**: Adding more people to a late project will only make it worse as new workers need time to learn from existing ones, and they are less productive.

#### (ii) Customer Myths:

The customer can be the direct users of the software, the technical team, marketing/sales department, or another company. Customers have myths leading to false expectations, creating dissatisfaction with developers.

- **Myth 1**: A general statement of intent is enough to start writing plans (software development), and details of objectives can be done over time.
  - **Fact**: A detailed description of database functions, ethical performance, and communication issues is necessary for development.

- **Myth 2**: Software requirements continually change, but change can be easily accommodated because software is flexible.
  - **Fact**: Changes are easier early in the development process. As time passes, changes become more costly due to committed resources.

#### (iii) Practitioner’s Myths:

- **Myth 1**: The work is complete once the plan is written.
  - **Fact**: 60-80% of effort goes into the maintenance phase after the product is delivered.

- **Myth 2**: There is no other way to achieve system quality until it is "running".
  - **Fact**: A systematic review of technology and quality filters is more effective than just testing.

- **Myth 3**: An operating system is the only product that can be successfully exported.
  - **Fact**: A working system alone is insufficient; documentation is essential for software support.

- **Myth 4**: Engineering software will always delay the process by creating unnecessary documents.
  - **Fact**: Software engineering is about creating a quality product, not just documentation.

## Program versus Software Product

| Feature               | Program                                  | Software Product                         |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**         | A set of instructions for a specific task | A complete, user-friendly software solution |
| **Development Approach**| Created by an individual for personal use | Developed using structured SDLC principles |
| **Scalability**         | Limited to a specific task or purpose   | Can be expanded and customized for various users |
| **User Interface**     | May not have a user-friendly interface  | Designed with UI/UX for ease of use     |
| **Testing & Debugging**| Minimal or no formal testing           | Rigorously tested for bugs and security |
| **Security**           | Basic or no security measures          | Includes security features              |
| **Example**            | A small Python script                   | Microsoft Word, Google Chrome, etc.     |

## Software Development Life Cycle Models 🌀🔁

SDLC is a process followed for software building within an organization. It involves a plan to develop, maintain, replace, and enhance specific software to improve quality.

### Phases of SDLC:

1. **Planning** 📊
   - Define project scope, objectives, and feasibility.
   - Estimate cost, time, and resources.

2. **Requirement Analysis** 📝
   - Gather and document user needs.
   - Identify functional and non-functional requirements.

3. **Design** 🎨
   - Create system architecture and UI/UX design.
   - Define database, modules, and data flow.

4. **Implementation (Coding)** 💻
   - Developers write and implement code.
   - Follows programming best practices.

5. **Testing** ✅
   - Identify and fix bugs before release.
   - Ensures software meets quality standards.

6. **Deployment** 🚀
   - Software is released for users.
   - Can be launched in phases (beta testing).

7. **Maintenance & Updates** 🔄
   - Fix issues, update features, and improve performance.
   - Ensure security and user satisfaction.

### Popular SDLC Models:

- **Waterfall Model** – Sequential, step-by-step approach.
- **Agile Model** – Iterative, flexible, and user-centric.
- **Spiral Model** – Risk-driven, combining iterative and waterfall methods.
