## Software Myths 😶🌫️👾

Software Myths are beliefs that do not have any pure evidence. Software myths may lead to many misunderstandings, unrealistic expectations, and poor decision-making in software development projects.

### The types of software-related myths are listed below:

#### (i) Management Myths:

- **Myth 1**: We have all the standards and procedures available for software development.
  - **Fact**: Software experts do not know all the requirements for software development, and all existing processes are incomplete as new software development is based on new and different problems.

- **Myth 2**: The addition of the latest hardware programs will improve software development.
  - **Fact**: The role of the latest hardware is not very high on standard software development; instead, CASE (Computer-Aided Software Engineering) tools help more in producing quality and productivity.

- **Myth 3**: With the addition of more people and program planners, software development can meet project deadlines (if lagging behind).
  - **Fact**: Adding more people to a late project will only make it worse as new workers need time to learn from existing ones, and they are less productive.

#### (ii) Customer Myths:

The customer can be the direct users of the software, the technical team, marketing/sales department, or another company. Customers have myths leading to false expectations, creating dissatisfaction with developers.

- **Myth 1**: A general statement of intent is enough to start writing plans (software development), and details of objectives can be done over time.
  - **Fact**: A detailed description of database functions, ethical performance, and communication issues is necessary for development.

- **Myth 2**: Software requirements continually change, but change can be easily accommodated because software is flexible.
  - **Fact**: Changes are easier early in the development process. As time passes, changes become more costly due to committed resources.

#### (iii) Practitioner’s Myths:

- **Myth 1**: The work is complete once the plan is written.
  - **Fact**: 60-80% of effort goes into the maintenance phase after the product is delivered.

- **Myth 2**: There is no other way to achieve system quality until it is "running".
  - **Fact**: A systematic review of technology and quality filters is more effective than just testing.

- **Myth 3**: An operating system is the only product that can be successfully exported.
  - **Fact**: A working system alone is insufficient; documentation is essential for software support.

- **Myth 4**: Engineering software will always delay the process by creating unnecessary documents.
  - **Fact**: Software engineering is about creating a quality product, not just documentation.
