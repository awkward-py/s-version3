## Software Myths 😶🌫️👾

Software Myths are beliefs that do not have any pure evidence. Software myths may lead to many misunderstandings, unrealistic expectations, and poor decision-making in software development projects.

### The types of software-related myths are listed below:

#### (i) Management Myths:

- **Myth 1**: We have all the standards and procedures available for software development.
  - **Fact**: Software experts do not know all the requirements for software development, and all existing processes are incomplete as new software development is based on new and different problems.

- **Myth 2**: The addition of the latest hardware programs will improve software development.
  - **Fact**: The role of the latest hardware is not very high on standard software development; instead, CASE (Computer-Aided Software Engineering) tools help more in producing quality and productivity.

- **Myth 3**: With the addition of more people and program planners, software development can meet project deadlines (if lagging behind).
  - **Fact**: Adding more people to a late project will only make it worse as new workers need time to learn from existing ones, and they are less productive.

#### (ii) Customer Myths:

The customer can be the direct users of the software, the technical team, marketing/sales department, or another company. Customers have myths leading to false expectations, creating dissatisfaction with developers.

- **Myth 1**: A general statement of intent is enough to start writing plans (software development), and details of objectives can be done over time.
  - **Fact**: A detailed description of database functions, ethical performance, and communication issues is necessary for development.

- **Myth 2**: Software requirements continually change, but change can be easily accommodated because software is flexible.
  - **Fact**: Changes are easier early in the development process. As time passes, changes become more costly due to committed resources.

#### (iii) Practitioner’s Myths:

- **Myth 1**: The work is complete once the plan is written.
  - **Fact**: 60-80% of effort goes into the maintenance phase after the product is delivered.

- **Myth 2**: There is no other way to achieve system quality until it is "running".
  - **Fact**: A systematic review of technology and quality filters is more effective than just testing.

- **Myth 3**: An operating system is the only product that can be successfully exported.
  - **Fact**: A working system alone is insufficient; documentation is essential for software support.

- **Myth 4**: Engineering software will always delay the process by creating unnecessary documents.
  - **Fact**: Software engineering is about creating a quality product, not just documentation.

1. **Correctness** ✅
   - The SRS must be accurate and free from errors.
   - All requirements should be validated and approved by stakeholders.
   - 📌**Example**: If an SRS for a banking system states that "Users can transfer money to their accounts," it should specify internal accounts or external accounts to avoid confusion.

2. **Completeness** 📋
   - The document should cover all functional, non-functional, and external requirements.
   - Should include edge cases, constraints, and assumptions.
   - 📌**Example**: If an SRS for an e-commerce website specifies a checkout process, it must also mention payment options, tax calculations, and invoice generation.

3. **Unambiguity** 🔍
   - Each requirement should have only one possible interpretation.
   - Avoid vague terms like "fast," "user-friendly," or "efficient."
   - 📌**Example**: Instead of saying "The system should respond quickly," say "The system should respond within 2 seconds for 95% of users."

4. **Consistency** 🔄
   - No contradictory or conflicting requirements.
   - The document should maintain a uniform terminology and structure.
   - 📌**Example**: If one section states that "Users can reset passwords via email" and another states that "Only administrators can reset passwords," there is an inconsistency.

5. **Verifiability** ✅
   - Each requirement should be testable with measurable criteria.
   - It should be possible to verify if the requirement is met.
   - 📌**Example**: "The system should support 500 concurrent users without crashing." This can be tested using performance testing tools.

6. **Modifiability** 🔧
   - The SRS should be easy to update when new requirements arise.
   - Use a modular structure so changes affect only specific sections.
   - 📌**Example**: If a travel booking system needs to add "Train Bookings" in addition to flights and hotels, the changes should be easily integrated into the document.

7. **Traceability** 🔗
   - Each requirement should be linked to its source (stakeholder request, business rule, law, etc.).
   - Helps track changes and ensure all requirements are implemented.
   - 📌**Example**: If a government portal requires compliance with GDPR regulations, the SRS should mention which requirements satisfy this law.

## Structure of a Requirements Document

The structure of a requirements document (commonly referred to as a Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document) is designed to provide a clear, organized, and detailed description of the system's requirements. A well-structured document helps ensure that the development team understands the user's needs and that the final product meets expectations.

A structured SRS document follows:

1. **Title Page** 🏷️:
   - Title: The name of the software project.
   - Version: Document version number.
   - Date: The date of document creation or the last update.
   - Author(s): The person(s) responsible for creating the document.
   - Approvals: Signatures or names of stakeholders approving the document.

2. **Table of Contents** 📑
   - A list of sections, subsections, and appendices with corresponding page numbers for easy navigation.

3. **Introduction** 📝
   - This section introduces the purpose of the document and provides an overview of the project.

4. **Overall Description** 🌍
   - This section gives a broad view of the software product, its goals, and its users.

5. **System Features** ⚙️
   - This section describes the functional requirements in detail. Each system feature must be described clearly to explain what the system will do.

6. **External Interface Requirements** 🌐
   - Defines the software’s interactions with external systems, hardware, and users.

7. **System Attributes** 🏅
   - Describes the non-functional requirements related to the performance, security, scalability, etc.

8. **Other Non-Functional Requirements** 🧑💻
   - Describes additional constraints and requirements that are important for the system but don’t fall under functionality.

9. **Appendices** 📚
   - Provides supplementary materials or resources that support the SRS.

10. **Approval and Sign-Off** 🖊️
    - A section for stakeholders or project managers to formally approve and sign the document.
