# 1. Introduction to .NET Framework (16 Periods)

## 1.1 Introduction to .NET Framework
The **.NET Framework** is a comprehensive development platform developed by Microsoft to create and run applications on the Windows operating system. It includes a large class library, known as the **Framework Class Library (FCL)**, and the **Common Language Runtime (CLR)**, which provides services such as garbage collection, exception handling, and security.

### Key Components of .NET Framework:
- **Common Language Runtime (CLR)**: The CLR is the heart of the .NET Framework. It provides the environment for executing .NET programs. The CLR takes care of managing memory, performing garbage collection, and providing various system services. It also allows for language interoperability, meaning code written in different languages can work together seamlessly.
- **Framework Class Library (FCL)**: The FCL is a vast collection of reusable classes, interfaces, and value types that provide system functionality such as file I/O, networking, and database connectivity.
- **Managed Code**: Code that is written to run within the CLR is referred to as **managed code**. The CLR handles memory allocation, garbage collection, and type safety for managed code.
- **Assembly**: An assembly is a compiled unit of code that contains metadata about the application. It is the fundamental unit of deployment in .NET. Assemblies can either be executables (EXE) or libraries (DLL).
  
### Working of the .NET Framework:
When you write a C# application and compile it, the code is converted into **Intermediate Language (IL)**. The CLR’s **Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler** then converts this IL into machine-specific code when the application is run.

```csharp
using System;

namespace HelloWorld
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Hello, .NET Framework!");
        }
    }
}
```

In the example above, when you compile the code, the output is Intermediate Language (IL). The JIT compiler converts this IL into machine code specific to your operating system when you run the application.

### Advantages of .NET Framework:
- Language Interoperability: The .NET framework allows multiple languages (C#, Visual Basic, F#) to interact with each other.
- Memory Management: The CLR handles garbage collection automatically, freeing developers from manual memory management.
- Platform Independence: While the .NET Framework is primarily for Windows, **.NET Core** (the cross-platform version) allows .NET applications to run on multiple operating systems.

## 1.2 Common Language Specification (CLS) – Assembly – Namespace

### Common Language Specification (CLS):
The **Common Language Specification (CLS)** defines a set of rules that all .NET languages should follow to ensure that they can interoperate. This ensures that code written in one .NET language can be used by other languages that follow the CLS. For instance, a class written in C# can be used in a Visual Basic application if both languages adhere to the CLS.

### Assembly:
An **assembly** is the fundamental unit of deployment in .NET. It contains the compiled code in the form of **Metadata** (information about types and members) and **IL Code** (the actual code written by the developer). Assemblies can be **Executable** files (`.exe`) or **Library** files (`.dll`).

#### Example of an Assembly:
When you compile a C# application, the output is an assembly. Here's a basic example:

```csharp
namespace MyApplication
{
    public class MyClass
    {
        public void DisplayMessage()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Hello from Assembly!");
        }
    }
}
```

### Namespaces:
A **namespace** is a way to group related classes, structs, and other types together, preventing name conflicts in large applications. They provide a logical organization of code. 

```csharp
namespace MyApplication.Utilities
{
    public class FileHelper
    {
        public static void ReadFile(string filePath)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Reading file: {filePath}");
        }
    }
}
```

In the above example, `MyApplication.Utilities` is the namespace, and `FileHelper` is the class that belongs to it.

## 1.3 Visual Studio .NET – Using the .NET Framework
### Visual Studio:
**Visual Studio** is a fully-featured Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for creating .NET applications. It simplifies the development process by providing tools for debugging, code completion, and GUI design. Visual Studio is the most commonly used IDE for .NET development.

### Features of Visual Studio:
- Code editor with syntax highlighting and IntelliSense (code suggestions)
- Debugger with breakpoints and watch windows
- Visual design tools (Windows Forms, ASP.NET, etc.)
- Integrated testing and version control systems (e.g., Git)

### Setting Up a .NET Framework Application in Visual Studio:
To create a new project in Visual Studio, follow these steps:
1. Open Visual Studio.
2. Go to `File > New > Project`.
3. Select the type of application you want (e.g., Console Application, Web Application).
4. Choose the programming language (e.g., C#, Visual Basic).

Here's a simple `Hello World` C# Console Application created in Visual Studio:

```csharp
using System;

namespace HelloWorldApp
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Hello, .NET Framework from Visual Studio!");
        }
    }
}
```

## 1.4 The Framework Class Library (FCL)
### Overview of FCL:
The **Framework Class Library (FCL)** is a huge collection of pre-built classes, interfaces, and types that provide common functionality such as file I/O, database connectivity, and user interfaces. The FCL is designed to simplify development by providing reusable, well-tested, and optimized code.

#### Example Using the FCL:
In the `System.IO` namespace, you have classes like `File`, `Directory`, and `StreamReader` to interact with the filesystem.

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;

namespace FileHandling
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            string path = "example.txt";
            File.WriteAllText(path, "Hello, FCL!");
            string content = File.ReadAllText(path);
            Console.WriteLine(content);
        }
    }
}
```
In the above example, the `File.WriteAllText()` method writes text to a file, and `File.ReadAllText()` reads the content from that file.

# 2. Introduction to C# (16 Periods)

## 2.1 Elements: Variables, Constants, Data Types, Operators
### Variables:
A **variable** is a container that holds data, and the data can change during the program's execution. A variable must have a data type (e.g., `int`, `string`, `bool`).

#### Example:
```csharp
int age = 30; // Variable declaration
string name = "Alice"; // String variable
```

### Constants:
A **constant** is similar to a variable but holds a value that cannot be changed after initialization. Constants are declared using the `const` keyword.

```csharp
const double Pi = 3.14159;
```

### Data Types:
C# supports two main categories of data types:
1. **Value Types**: These store the actual data. Examples include `int`, `char`, `bool`, `float`.
2. **Reference Types**: These store references to the data. Examples include `string`, `arrays`, and `class`.

#### Value Types:
```csharp
int x = 5; // Integer
double y = 4.5; // Double
bool isTrue = true; // Boolean
```

#### Reference Types:
```csharp
string name = "John"; // String is a reference type
int[] numbers = { 1, 2, 3 }; // Arrays are reference types
```

### Operators:
C# provides several types of operators, including:
- **Arithmetic Operators**: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`
- **Relational Operators**: `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`
- **Logical Operators**: `&&`, `||`, `!`

#### Example:
```csharp
int a = 10;
int b = 20;
Console.WriteLine(a + b); // Output: 30
Console.WriteLine(a == b); // Output: False
Console.WriteLine(a > b); // Output: False
```

---

## 2.2 Loop Statements: `while`, `for`, `foreach`
### `while` loop:
The **`while` loop** continues to execute as long as the condition is true. 

```csharp
int i = 0;
while (i < 5)
{
    Console.WriteLine(i);
    i++; // Increment
}
```

### `for` loop:
The **`for` loop** is ideal when you know the number of iterations in advance.

```csharp
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
{
    Console.WriteLine(i);
}
```

### `foreach` loop:
The **`foreach` loop** is used to iterate over collections like arrays and lists.

```csharp
string[] fruits = { "Apple", "Banana", "Cherry" };
foreach (string fruit in fruits)
{
    Console.WriteLine(fruit);
}
```

---

## 2.3 Types: Value Types, Reference Types, Arrays
### Value Types:
Value types directly store the data, and each variable has its own copy of the data.

#### Example of Value Type:
```csharp
int x = 100;
int y = x; // y gets a copy of x's value
```

### Reference Types:
Reference types store references (memory addresses) to the actual data. If one reference type is modified, it affects all references to that object.

#### Example of Reference Type:
```csharp
class Person
{
    public string Name;
}

Person p1 = new Person();
p1.Name = "Alice";

Person p2 = p1; // p2 refers to the same object as p1
p2.Name = "Bob"; // Modifying p2 also modifies p1

Console.WriteLine(p1.Name); // Output: Bob
```

### Arrays:
An **array** is a collection of elements of the same type. Arrays are reference types in C#.

```csharp
int[] numbers = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
foreach (int number in numbers)
{
    Console.WriteLine(number);
}
```

---

## 2.4 Classes and Objects: Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism
### Classes and Objects:
A **class** is a blueprint for creating objects, which are instances of the class. It defines properties (data) and methods (functions) that the objects can have.

```csharp
class Car
{
    public string Make;
    public string Model;

    public void Start()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Car started.");
    }
}

Car myCar = new Car();
myCar.Make = "Tesla";
myCar.Start();
```

### Abstraction:
**Abstraction** means hiding the implementation details and exposing only the necessary parts to the user. It is implemented through **abstract classes** and **interfaces**.

```csharp
abstract class Shape
{
    public abstract void Draw();
}

class Circle : Shape
{
    public override void Draw()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Drawing a circle.");
    }
}
```

### Inheritance:
**Inheritance** allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class.

```csharp
class Animal
{
    public void Speak()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("

Animal speaks");
    }
}

class Dog : Animal
{
    public void Bark()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Dog barks");
    }
}
```

### Polymorphism:
**Polymorphism** allows objects of different types to be treated as objects of a common base type. It is implemented through method overriding and method overloading.

```csharp
class Bird : Animal
{
    public override void Speak()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Bird sings");
    }
}
```
